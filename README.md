# Bayesian Inference for a Variable-Coefficient Heat Equation

This repository implements a simulation-based Bayesian inverse problem for a one-dimensional heat equation with a spatially varying diffusion coefficient. The goal is to infer unknown material parameters from sparse and noisy temperature observations while quantifying uncertainty in the estimates. Currently only the forward solver has been implemented. 

This project serves as my project for ISC4943, Senior Practicum in FSU's Department of Scientific Computing.
